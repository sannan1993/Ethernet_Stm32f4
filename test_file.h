"In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit. Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with the "
"ends of worms and an oozy smell, nor yet a dry, bare, sandy hole with nothing in it to sit "
"down on or to eat: it was a hobbit-hole, and that means comfort. "
"It had a perfectly round door like a porthole, painted green, with a shiny yellow brass "
"knob in the exact middle. The door opened on to a tubeshaped hall like a tunnel: a very "
"comfortable tunnel without smoke, with panelled walls, and floors tiled and carpeted, "
"provided with polished chairs, and lots and lots of pegs for hats and coats - the hobbit "
"was fond of visitors. The tunnel wound on and on, going fairly but not quite straight into "
"the side of the hill - The Hill, as all the people for many miles round called it - and many "
"little round doors opened out of it, first on one side and then on another."
